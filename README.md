# Financial-Instrument-Simulation-and-Analysis
Stock&amp;Bond_DB
The code structure is modular, with each task encapsulated within its function. Parameters are passed to functions as arguments, and the overall flow of the program is easy to follow.

1. Import Libraries:
      These lines import the necessary libraries: NumPy for numerical computations and matplotlib.pyplot for plotting.
2. Simulation Function:
      This function run_simulation simulates the prices of a financial instrument (e.g., stock or bond) over a specified number of years and simulations. It uses nested loops to iterate over each simulation and each year, updating the price based on random fluctuations modeled by a normal distribution.
3. Performance Calculation Function:
      This function calculate_performance computes various performance metrics based on the simulated prices over time. It calculates returns, average return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and 
      maximum drawdown.
4. Plotting Function:
      This function plot_simulation creates a visualization of the simulation results. It plots the mean price trajectories and returns histograms for stocks and bonds over a specified     
      number of years.
5. Plot_simulation:
      By examining these plots, you can gain a better understanding of how the simulated financial instruments behave over time and the distribution of returns associated with them.
      This information can be valuable for assessing the performance and risk characteristics of stocks and bonds in the simulated scenario.
